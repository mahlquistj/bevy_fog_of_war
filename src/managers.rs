/// Resource for efficient chunk coordinate to entity mapping and lookups.
/// 快速查找区块坐标对应的 FogChunk 实体
///
/// This resource provides O(1) lookup from chunk coordinates to their corresponding
/// Bevy entity IDs. It serves as the primary index for the chunk-based fog of war system,
/// enabling efficient queries and updates without iterating through all chunk entities.
///
/// # Purpose
///
/// The fog of war system needs to frequently:
/// - Find entities for specific world positions
/// - Update chunks when vision sources move
/// - Manage chunk lifecycle (spawn/despawn)
/// - Transfer data between CPU and GPU for specific chunks
///
/// Without this index, these operations would require expensive O(N) entity queries.
///
/// # Performance Characteristics
/// - **Lookup Time**: O(1) average case, O(log N) worst case
/// - **Memory Usage**: ~24 bytes per chunk (HashMap overhead + coordinate + entity ID)
/// - **Thread Safety**: Resource managed by Bevy's ECS system
/// - **Cache Efficiency**: High due to spatial locality of chunk access patterns
///
/// # Lifecycle Management
/// - **Insertion**: When new chunks are spawned via `commands.spawn()`
/// - **Lookup**: During vision calculations, rendering, and memory management
/// - **Removal**: When chunks are despawned or during system resets
/// - **Cleanup**: Automatically handled by ECS when entities are despawned
///
/// # Usage Patterns
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use bevy::prelude::*;
/// # use bevy_fog_of_war::prelude::*;
/// fn find_chunk_at_position(
///     manager: Res<ChunkEntityManager>,
///     settings: Res<FogMapSettings>,
///     chunks: Query<&FogChunk>,
/// ) {
///     let world_pos = Vec2::new(300.0, 400.0);
///     let chunk_coord = settings.world_to_chunk_coords(world_pos);
///
///     if let Some(entity) = manager.map.get(&chunk_coord) {
///         if let Ok(chunk) = chunks.get(*entity) {
///             println!("Found chunk at {:?}", chunk.coords);
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Consistency Guarantees
/// - Map entries should always correspond to valid, existing entities
/// - All spawned FogChunk entities should have entries in this map
/// - Coordinates should be unique (one entity per coordinate)
/// - Cleanup should happen atomically with entity despawning

/// Performance-critical state cache tracking chunk coordinates in various states.
/// 缓存各种状态的区块坐标集合，用于系统间的快速查询
///
/// This resource maintains high-performance hash sets of chunk coordinates categorized
/// by their current state. It enables O(1) state queries and efficient bulk operations
/// across multiple systems without expensive entity iteration or component queries.
///
/// # Performance Optimization
///
/// Instead of querying all chunk entities every frame to determine their states,
/// systems can efficiently check these cached sets:
/// - **Before**: O(N) entity iteration + component access
/// - **After**: O(1) HashSet lookup
///
/// # State Categories
///
/// ## Visibility States (Gameplay)
/// - `visible_chunks`: Currently in active vision
/// - `explored_chunks`: Ever been visible (persistent)
///
/// ## System States (Performance)
/// - `camera_view_chunks`: Within camera viewport (culling)
/// - `gpu_resident_chunks`: Allocated on GPU (memory management)
///
/// # Update Patterns
/// - **Frame-based**: `visible_chunks`, `camera_view_chunks` updated every frame
/// - **Persistent**: `explored_chunks` accumulates over time, rarely cleared
/// - **Memory-driven**: `gpu_resident_chunks` updated during allocation/deallocation
///
/// # Memory Usage
/// Each HashSet uses ~8 bytes per coordinate plus overhead. With typical chunk counts:
/// - Small games: ~1KB total
/// - Large games: ~10-100KB total
/// - Trade-off: Small memory cost for significant performance gains
///
/// # System Coordination
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use bevy::prelude::*;
/// # use bevy_fog_of_war::prelude::*;
/// fn efficient_chunk_processing(
///     cache: Res<ChunkStateCache>,
///     chunks: Query<&mut FogChunk>,
/// ) {
///     // Only process chunks that are both visible and in camera view
///     for coord in cache.visible_chunks.intersection(&cache.camera_view_chunks) {
///         // Process only relevant chunks (typically 10-50 instead of 1000+)
///         println!("Processing visible chunk in camera view: {:?}", coord);
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Cache Consistency
/// Cache must stay synchronized with actual chunk states:
/// - **Critical**: Out-of-sync cache leads to rendering artifacts or performance issues
/// - **Responsibility**: Each system that changes chunk state must update the cache
/// - **Verification**: Debug builds can validate cache consistency

/// Advanced GPU texture array layer allocation manager for fog of war chunks.
/// GPU纹理数组层分配管理器
///
/// This manager handles the complex task of dynamically allocating and deallocating
/// texture array layers for fog chunks on the GPU. It maintains separate pools of
/// fog and snapshot texture layers, enabling efficient memory management for the
/// chunk-based fog of war system.
///
/// # GPU Texture Arrays
///
/// Modern GPUs use texture arrays to efficiently render multiple textures in a single
/// draw call. Each "layer" in the array is essentially a separate texture that can be
/// accessed by index in shaders. This manager treats these layers as a limited resource
/// pool that must be carefully managed.
///
/// # Architecture
///
/// ## Dual Texture System
/// Each chunk requires two texture layers:
/// - **Fog Layer**: Real-time visibility data (continuously updated)
/// - **Snapshot Layer**: Persistent exploration data (updated when areas become explored)
///
/// ## Allocation Strategy
/// - **Pool-based**: Maintains free lists of available layer indices
/// - **Independent Pools**: Fog and snapshot layers are allocated separately
/// - **Reuse**: Freed layers are returned to pools for reuse
/// - **Persistence Support**: Can allocate specific layers for save/load functionality
///
/// # Performance Characteristics
/// - **Allocation**: O(1) - pop from Vec
/// - **Deallocation**: O(N) - includes double-free protection checks
/// - **Lookup**: O(1) - HashMap coordinate to layer mapping
/// - **Memory**: ~24 bytes per allocated chunk + pool overhead
///
/// # Memory Management Flow
/// ```text
/// 1. Chunk becomes visible → allocate_layer_indices()
/// 2. Chunk used for rendering → GPU rendering system accesses layers
/// 3. Chunk moves far from camera → free_layer_indices_for_coord()
/// 4. Layers returned to pool → available for reuse
/// ```
///
/// # Capacity Management
/// - **Maximum Layers**: Defined by `MAX_LAYERS` constant (typically 64)
/// - **Memory Pressure**: When pools empty, chunks must be moved to CPU memory
/// - **Prioritization**: Visible chunks prioritized over distant chunks
///
/// # Example Usage
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use bevy_fog_of_war::prelude::*;
/// # use bevy::prelude::*;
/// fn allocate_chunk_on_gpu(
///     mut manager: ResMut<TextureArrayManager>,
///     coords: IVec2,

///     } else {
///         println!("No GPU layers available for chunk {:?}", coords);
///     }
/// }
/// ```

/// # Safety and Consistency
/// - **Double-free Protection**: Prevents allocation of already-allocated layers

    /// resetting the entire texture array manager to its initial state. This is used for
    /// complete fog of war system resets, level transitions, or debug commands.
    ///
    /// # Reset Operations
    /// 1. **Clear Mapping**: Removes all coordinate-to-layer mappings
    /// 2. **Reset Pools**: Rebuilds free layer pools with all indices
    /// 3. **Restore Order**: Returns indices in sequential order (0, 1, 2, ...)
    /// 4. **Log Reset**: Info logs the complete reset operation
    ///
    /// # Performance Characteristics
    /// - **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n = capacity (rebuilds both free pools)
    /// - **Space Complexity**: O(1) (reuses existing Vec capacity)
    /// - **Memory Allocation**: No new allocations (clears and refills existing Vecs)
    /// - **Frequency**: Infrequent operation (only during major state changes)
    ///
    /// # State After Reset
    /// After calling this method, the manager returns to the same state as `new()`:
    /// - All layer indices 0..capacity-1 are available for allocation
    /// - No coordinates have GPU allocations
    /// - Free pools contain all indices in sequential order
    /// - Ready to allocate layers for any chunk coordinates
    ///
    /// # Example Usage
    /// ```rust,no_run
    /// # use bevy_fog_of_war::prelude::*;
    /// # use bevy::prelude::*;
    /// let mut manager = TextureArrayManager::new(64);

    /// // Allocate some layers
    /// manager.allocate_layer_indices(IVec2::new(0, 0));
    /// manager.allocate_layer_indices(IVec2::new(1, 1));
    ///
    /// // Later, reset everything

    ///
    /// // Now all 64 layers are available again

    /// # When to Use
